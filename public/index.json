The scope is wide, covering both people and freight transportation and logistics, by all modes, at all geographical extensions, and at all levels of planning, analysis, and operations. The TRISTAN conferences gather top research scientists from universities and research institutes from all over the world along with scientific participants from the private sectors and public agencies, as well as graduate students. They provide an agora for high-spirited and broad exchanges of ideas, reflections, and discussions on the topics and areas of interest, aiming to foster scientific and social networking and international cooperation. Extensive information on TRISTAN and the past conferences may be found at https://tristanconference.org/\nA TRISTAN conference is to be organized by a group of people acknowledged within the community. With respect to location, this also translates into a desire to be inclusive and move the conference around the world where there are important or emerging groups of researchers in Transportation Science. Given the Pacific and Indian oceans locations of the last conferences - Australia, Mauritius, and Japan -, proposals from locations around the Atlantic ocean are strongly encouraged.\nThe proposals will be presented to all participants to TRISTAN XII, which will take place June 22-28 2025, on the island of Okinawa, Japan. The final selection will then be made by the conference participants who will vote during the social dinner on Thursday evening.\nAll demands for additional information and the expressions of interest to organize the 2028 TRISTAN should be set to us at tristansymposium@gmail.com\nWe take this opportunity to wish you and your sthe most wonderful year 2025!\nTeodor Gabriel Crainic Chair TRISTAN Steering Committee TeodorGabriel.Crainic@cirrelt.net tristansymposium@gmail.com\n","date":1736899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1736899200,"objectID":"16e7a626afcdc09c41cc13553ca3b4aa","permalink":"https://tristan2025.org/post/7_tristan2028_call/","publishdate":"2025-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/7_tristan2028_call/","section":"post","summary":"The Steering Committee is seeking Expressions of Interest from groups interested in hosting TRISTAN XIII in June 2028.","tags":["announcement"],"title":"Call for Expressions of Interest to Host TRISTAN XIII in 2028","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"To accommodate the overwhelming number of submissions we received (thank you so much!), we have adjusted the schedule to start sessions on Sunday.
